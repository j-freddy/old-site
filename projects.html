  - title: Peer Assessment
    description: "This web app is produced from scratch using Flask and SQLAlchemy. I was one of the main
    developers during my placement with DoC EdTech. It currently serves as the peer assessment platform for the
    department of computing at Imperial College."
  - title: TA Tracker
    description: "Another web app that I co-developed during my internship with DoC EdTech. TA Tracker manages all
    activity related to teaching assistants at DoC Imperial College, except payment."
  - title: Java Pawn Race
    description: "Despite being one of the winners of the Kotlin AI Pawn Race in my 1st year at Imperial, I challenged
    myself to create a stronger AI. I prototyped a chess program I built to support Pawn Race, and programmed a minimax
    algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, using the strategy of 'space control' as a static evaluator. It triumphed over my
    Kotlin MCTS AI."
  - title: Duel!
    description: "Inspired by Eggnogg, a 2P shooter game I enjoyed many years ago, I created my own version in Unity3D.
    This project was created in 1 week for Brackeys Jam 2020.2"

title: Ultimate TicTacToe
rules:
  - Each small 3×3 board is a local board, and the larger 3×3 board is the global board.
  - When a player plays a move, it sends their opponent to its relative location on the global board.
  - If a player wins on a local board, that board gets captured by the player.
  - If a player is sent to a local board that is full or captured, then that player may choose any other board.
  - A player wins by winning on the global board.

  - title: Java Pawn Race
    description: "Despite being one of the winners of the Kotlin AI Pawn Race in my 1st year at Imperial, I challenged
    myself to create a stronger AI. I prototyped a chess program I built to support Pawn Race, and programmed a minimax
    algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, using the strategy of 'space control' as a static evaluator. It triumphed over my
    Kotlin MCTS AI."

  - title: Classic Tetris
    description: "This is a faithful reproduction of the original NTSC NES Tetris 1989, with a more modern/minimalistic

    playable on this site soon!"

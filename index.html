            I am a 2nd year
            <span class="text-with-tooltip" data-bs-toggle="tooltip" title="Joint Maths and Computing">JMC</span>
            student at Imperial College
            London. I have experience in a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, as well as professional
            experience in both frontend and backend development. I have a strong interest in the field of machine
            learning, but I am always looking to try something new - in fact, this site was an attempt at familiarising
            myself with Jekyll.
        </p>
        <p> You can find a portfolio of my projects on this site. I'm also hosting 2 JavaScript games I made a few years
            ago (for PCs only):
            <a href="projects/twisted">Twisted</a> and <a href="projects/ultimate-tictactoe">Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe</a>

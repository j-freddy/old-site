            I am a 2nd year <span class="bg-warning">JMC</span> student at Imperial College London. I have experience in
            a wide range of programming languages and frameworks, as well as professional experience in both frontend
            and backend development. I have a strong interest in the field of machine learning, but I am always looking
            to try something new - in fact, this site was an attempt at familiarising myself with Jekyll.
        </p>
        <p> You can find a portfolio of my projects on this site. I'm also hosting 2 JavaScript games I made a few years
            ago (for PCs only):
            <a href="projects/twisted">Twisted</a> and <a href="projects/ultimate-tictactoe">Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe</a>

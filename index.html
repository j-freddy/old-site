<p>
    I am a 2nd year <span class="bg-warning">JMC</span> student at Imperial College London. I have experience in a wide
    range of programming languages and frameworks, as well as professional experience in both frontend and backend
    development. I have a strong interest in the field of machine learning, but I am always looking to try something new
    - in fact, this site was an attempt at familiarising myself with Jekyll.

<p> You can find a portfolio of my projects here. I'm also hosting 2 JavaScript games I made a few years ago, which you
    can try out. </p>
